I'm excited to share my latest project where I explored the Student Depression Dataset 📚 using data visualization and analytics techniques.

🔎 Through this interactive dashboard:

Analyzed the impact of academic pressure, financial stress, and study satisfaction on depression levels among students.

Visualized depression distribution by CGPA, work/study hours, and suicidal thoughts.

Created an interactive geographical view to understand regional patterns.

Enabled dynamic filtering based on degree programs for deeper insights.
🛠 Tools Used:

Power BI

Pandas (Python)

DAX

Data Cleaning (Excel)
This project highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in addressing mental health challenges faced by students today. 🌍✨
